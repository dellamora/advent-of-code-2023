# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŒŸ

This is a collection of my attempts at solving the challenges so please don't expect anything mind-blowing here. There are likely much smarter and more efficient ways to achieve the same results. This repository serves as a personal learning journey, and I encourage you to explore different approaches and learn from them.


## What is Advent of Code?

In case you haven't heard, Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles released each day in December. It's a great opportunity to enhance your problem-solving skills and explore different aspects of programming. You can find the challenges and participate in the event on the [Advent of Code 2023 website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Feel free to explore my solutions and provide feedback or share your own approaches. (just don't be mean)
